# Reporting Module  
## Dependencies
  * [fpdf2](https://github.com/py-pdf/fpdf2)

We provide a script that generates a PDF report of each el_gato run using the report.json file generated in the output folder for each sample.  
This report generated by Nextflow by default, but must be run manually if running el_gato for individual samples. 
A report can be generated for one or more samples and may include both assembly and read report jsons.
```
elgato_report.py -i <path/to/report1.json> [<path/to/report2.json> ...] -o <path/to/output/report.pdf>
```
