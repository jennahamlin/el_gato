# Reporting Module  

We provide a script that generates a PDF report of each el_gato run using the report.json file generated in the output folder for each sample.
Nextflow generates this report by default, but you must run it manually if you run el_gato for individual samples. You can generate a report for one or more samples, including assembly, and read reports.
